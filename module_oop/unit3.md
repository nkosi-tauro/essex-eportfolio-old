The Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a widely used modeling language for software development that helps to visualize, specify, construct, and document software systems. UML provides several models that are applicable at different stages of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). Here are some of the most common UML models and their applicability in different SDLC stages:

Use Case Diagrams: Use case diagrams are typically used in the requirements gathering phase of the SDLC. They help to identify the actors involved in the system and their goals, as well as the different use cases that the system must support.

Activity Diagrams: Activity diagrams are used in the design phase of the SDLC to describe the workflow or the process of a system. They can help to identify any inefficiencies or bottlenecks in the system.

Class Diagrams: Class diagrams are used in the design phase of the SDLC to describe the structure of a system. They can help to identify the different classes in the system, their relationships, and their attributes and methods.

Sequence Diagrams: Sequence diagrams are used in the design phase of the SDLC to describe the interactions between different objects or classes in a system. They can help to identify any potential issues with the system's behavior.

State Machine Diagrams: State machine diagrams are used in the design phase of the SDLC to describe the behavior of a system or an object. They can help to identify the different states that an object can be in and the transitions between those states.

Component Diagrams: Component diagrams are used in the implementation phase of the SDLC to describe the physical components of a system and how they interact with each other.

Deployment Diagrams: Deployment diagrams are used in the implementation phase of the SDLC to describe how a system is deployed in a physical environment. They can help to identify any potential issues with the system's deployment.

In summary, different UML models have different applicability at different stages of the SDLC. Use case diagrams and activity diagrams are useful in the requirements gathering and design phases, while class diagrams, sequence diagrams, and state machine diagrams are useful in the design phase. Component diagrams and deployment diagrams are useful in the implementation phase.

- <b>Instructions</b>: Making reference to ‘The Unified Modeling Language Reference Manual Second Edition’, use the State Machine Diagram in Figure 3-7 to design a similar model for a washing machine.
