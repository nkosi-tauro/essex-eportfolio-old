title: "Assignment Topic: A Design Proposal of Software to Support Operation of a Driverless Car"
permalink: module_oop/system_implementation/
---


**Assignment Brief**: You are now required to implement the code designed to support the operation of a driverless car as described in Unit 7. This should be representative of the use case diagram, activity diagram, class diagram, sequence diagram, and state transition diagram defined in your design document. Please do modify any of the diagrammatic capabilities in response to advancements in your thought process since the design document was submitted, or in response to feedback received.

Please write and test your scripts in Codio using the Python workspace created for you. All code scripts must be documented, explained, and follow best practices. You should ensure that your code is fully tested and provide evidence of your testing. Use Python's assert statement to achieve automated testing, in addition to any other types of testing you believe are useful in this deployment.
