## [Assignment](#assignment)
This unit also inlcuded the second module assignment. We were tasked to implement a driverless car based on the [system design proposal](/eportfolio/module_oop/system_design/) document.

## [Reflection](#reflection)
This was quite a difficult assignment, as I did not do too well (or as I had expected) in the system design proposal, I had to re-think my approach to implementing the OOP structure for my driverless car program. A definite saving grace was that we did not have to stick to the exact same structure as the proposal, so I was able to make the necessary changes required.
