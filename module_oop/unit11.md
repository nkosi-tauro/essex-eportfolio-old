## [Assignment](#assignment)
This unit also inlcuded the second module assignment. We were tasked to implement a driverless car based on the [system design proposal](/eportfolio/module_oop/system_design/) document.

## [Reflection](#reflection)
I definetly have an appreciation for python not having pointers. The learning overhead it introduces can seem a bit daunting. As developer who mainly uses JavaScript/Typescript adapting to python has been a seemless process. I have been able to pick up the syntax and the language features with ease. However, I want to get into game development so sooner or later I will have to pick up C++. I am _not_ looking forward to learning about pointers and memory management, but _jokes_ aside I am sure it will be a challenge but I am looking forward to it.

Another critical component this module brought to my attention was Design Patterns. As a mostly self-taught developer, I had heard about the term before but never really understood what it was all about. Learning about the different patterns and how they can be applied to different scenarios was very insightful, it made me realise that there should be a balance struck between theory and practical, one should be able to think critically, because at the end of the day programming is problem solving.
