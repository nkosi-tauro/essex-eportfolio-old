**Scenario**: As a Software Engineer, you are given the role of designing the software which supports the operation of a self-driving car. In your research around the capabilities of self-driving cars, you can search for keywords that include autonomous vehicle, driverless car, robotic car.

You are required to identify three operations that you wish to support in your software and provision capability for them through the use of an object-oriented Python program. The system should support the ability for a customer to interact with the system through a front-end.

Running in the system back-end should be a capability that simulates the generation and collection of data attributes that represent the wider environment within which the driverless car is operating.

## Learning Objectives
- Prepare UML models to support the object oriented design process.
- Implement data search algorithms to process stored data in the most efficient approaches.
