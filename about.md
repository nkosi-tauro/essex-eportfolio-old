{: data-content="Introduction"}

Hi there, my name is Nkosilathi Tauro, and I am a Developer hailing from Cape Town, RSA. Currently, I am pursuing my postgraduate degree at the University of Essex. I thrive on solving problems, and I often use technology as my tool of choice. I am committed to producing high-quality code, and I take pride in the work that I deliver.

Mentoring others brings me joy, and I enjoy doing it both in-person and virtually. I possess excellent communication skills, which allow me to work well independently or as part of a team. Identifying and solving problems is a strength of mine, and I am always looking to learn and grow.

My areas of expertise include web development, data science, and game development. While I love coding in JavaScript and Python, I am not picky about what languages or stacks I work with. I am a quick learner, and I can adapt to new skills as needed.
